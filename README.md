# Deep learning with probabilistic models for segmenting lung lobes on computed tomography images with severe abnormalities

Initial project presented at the XXIX Congresso Brasileiro de Engenharia Biomédica (CBEB) 2024 (https://sbeb.org.br/cbeb2024)

## Abstract

> The development of efficient and robust algorithms for lung and lobe segmentation is essential for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and lung cancer. However, obtaining manual or automatic annotations of lung lobes is challenging, especially in patients with severe pulmonary abnormalities due to the difficulty of visualizing the lobar fissures. This work aims to provide an automated lung lobe segmentation method using deep neural networks and probabilistic models, called LobePrior. Segmentation is performed in three stages: a coarse stage that processes images with reduced resolution; a high-resolution stage, in which specialized AttUNets compete for the segmentation of each lung lobe; and a final stage where post-processing is applied to the segmented lobes. Probabilistic models, constructed from label fusion, are used to guide the model in regions where severe abnormalities have caused segmentation failures. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated on LOLA11 (Grand Challenge) and four datasets with manual lobe annotations, in the presence of cancerous nodules and COVID-19 consolidations. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that LobePrior achieved more accurate segmentations, closely matching the reference segmentation. All these results, when compared to other approaches, indicate that the LobePrior method achieved superior performance in lung lobe segmentation. The method has been incorporated into a tool developed by the MICLab group, called MEDPSeg, available on GitHub at [MEDPSeg](https://github.com/MICLab-Unicamp/medpseg).

# To install dependencies
> sh requirements.txt

# Installation

First, clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/MICLab-Unicamp/LobePrior

Due to the large size of network weights, you need to go into the Releases in this repository, download the data.zip file, and put it inside the medpseg folder. This can be done through the command line with:

> cd LobePrior
> wget https://github.com/MICLab-Unicamp/LobePrior/releases/download/LobePrior/dados.zip

If this method of downloading the weights doesn't work for you, use this alternative link [Data](https://github.com/MICLab-Unicamp/LobePrior/releases/download/LobePrior/dados.zip).

Extract the .ckpt files inside the LobePrior/weight folder and raw_images inside the LobePrior folder.

> unzip data.zip

Finally, go into the top level folder, inside LobePrior folder.

# To run project

> python main.py

<!--
We present an approach using probabilistic models, constructed from lung CT images. The images were recorded and separated into groups, according to shape and appearance. The images were separated into groups because of the great difference between the shapes that the lung has between patients. Added to post-processing and templates, a model capable of segmenting CT images of lungs affected by severe diseases was developed. The main contribution of this work was to improve the quality of these segmentations and present a model capable of identifying lobar fissures more efficiently, as this is a task considered very difficult, overcoming the difficulty of the methods in finding the fissures correctly, as they are healthy. deformed by lung diseases such as cancer and COVID-19.
