# README — Dataset and Tools for Medical Image Visualization and Analysis

This repository contains medical image files, annotations, visualization scripts, and a tutorial to assist with data manipulation and analysis. The files are organized to support studies and experiments with biomedical imaging, particularly in lung computed tomography (CT).

## Repository Contents

1. **Compressed folder with annotations in NRRD format (`.nrrd`)**
   - Two compressed folder containing **segmented annotations** of the medical images.
   - Folder with files used to represent anatomical masks such as lung lobes.
   - Compatible with visualization and editing software like **ITK-Snap** and **3D Slicer**.

2. **Compressed folder with Volumetric Image in NIfTI format (`.nii.gz`)**
   - Folder containing the high-resolution CT volumes of the HCU dataset.
   - Widely used format in medical imaging, compatible with **NiBabel**, **3D Slicer**, **ITK-Snap**, among others.

3. **Compressed folder containing files and scripts**
   - Contains **Python scripts** with examples of loading, visualizing, and analyzing the images and annotations.
   - It also includes a guide on how to use the ITK-SNAP software.
   - Includes plots, 2D/3D visualizations, and basic analyses using libraries such as `nibabel`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `SimpleITK`, and `itk`.

4. **Tutorial PDF**
   - Practical guide on how to use **ITK-Snap** to view and edit images and annotations.
   - Step-by-step instructions with screenshots.

## Recommended Software

### 1. **ITK-Snap**
- Free software for semi-automatic segmentation and annotation of medical images.
- Supports `.nii.gz` and `.nrrd` files with overlay visualization.
- Website: [http://www.itksnap.org](http://www.itksnap.org)

### 2. **3D Slicer**
- Open-source platform for 3D visualization and analysis of medical data.
- Supports multiple formats including `.nrrd` and `.nii.gz`.
- Allows quantitative analysis, segmentation, and 3D rendering.
- Website: [https://www.slicer.org](https://www.slicer.org)

### 3. **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**
- Interactive environment for developing and visualizing data using Python scripts.
- Useful libraries:
  - `nibabel`: to read `.nii.gz` files
  - `simpleitk` / `itk`: for medical image processing
  - `numpy`, `matplotlib`: for analysis and visualization
- Recommended tools: **JupyterLab** or **VS Code**

## Requirements to Run the Notebooks

Install the following packages using `pip` or `conda`:

```bash
pip install nibabel simpleitk numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

Or with Conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nibabel simpleitk matplotlib jupyter
```

## How to Visualize the Images

1. **In ITK-Snap**:
   - Load the `.nii.gz` file as the main image.
   - Load the `.nrrd` files as additional segmentations.
   - Use the PDF tutorial for detailed guidance.

2. **In 3D Slicer**:
   - Go to `Add Data` and select both the image and annotation files.
   - Use the segmentation and 3D visualization modules.

3. **In Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Run the provided notebook.
   - Visualize image slices and segmentations or generate basic 3D renderings.
   - The images and their annotations can also be read using NumPy, with Python code.
